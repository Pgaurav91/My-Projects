This project is to uncover actionable insights from airlines datasets. I have used PowerBI to import the csv files and perform data cleaning and data modelling. And, then I have used created measures using DAX function.
I have used the concept of slicers to filter the data within visuals. Also, I have created different visuals like bar chart, donut chart. I have also used advanced visualizations like Decomposition tree and Q&A.
Also, I have used the concept of bookmarks and drillthrough. Also, I have created a dashboard to show the visuals in a single page.
